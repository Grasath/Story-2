The trees were tall and lush, and the animals were friendly and talkative. 
Lily was amazed by the beauty of the forest and decided to spend the day exploring. 
As she wandered deeper into the forest, she came across a small cottage. 
When she knocked on the door, an old lady with kind eyes welcomed her in. 
The old lady told Lily that she was the guardian of the forest and that the keyhole on the tree was the entrance to the magical world of the forest. 
Lily was thrilled and felt grateful to have discovered such a beautiful place.
